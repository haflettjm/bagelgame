    In bagels a deductive logic game you must guess a three digit number based on clues.
    Pico when the guess has a correct digit in the correct place.
    Bagels when the guess has no correct digits.
    10 tries total to guess the secret number.
    (Maybe add in 3rd hint option for guessing a digit that is in the number)
    
    Book suggests adding in different length numbers maybe adding in letters as well as numbers
    Possibly add in these options for user choice?
    Was able to do all of the project without looking at book except for the clues per digit.

    Learned quite a bit about how stupid conditional statements can be in while and if loops.
